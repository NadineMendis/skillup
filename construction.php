            	<h2>Construction</h2>
                
                <p>The Construction industry is one of the leading sectors in Sri Lanka that contributes to our national GDP. Even in times of economic adversity, this sector has been doing leaps and bounds better than any other local contributing sector. The construction sector helps create a multiplier effect that leads to sustainable national economic growth through a natural development process</p>
<p>This sector is made up for seven sub-sectors which include buildings, highways, bridge and water supply, drainage and dredging, reclamation and other construction. The sub-sectors are mainly driven by private enterprise, but the government and the urban development authority (UDA) spearhead plans for the greater infrastructure development nationwide. </p>
<p>The main employment opportunities that exist in the construction sector are masons, labor-construction, carpentry, technical officers, quantity surveyors, painters and project managers.
Vocational training in Construction is a great way to start a career in this ever-growing industry. You will be trained by professionals who will make sure you receive the right guidance.
