            	<h2>Light Engineering & Automative</h2>
                
                <p>Labour intensive enterprises that focus on metal processing with the use of arc or gas welding and lathe work help produce a range of goods falls under automotive and light engineering. Many industries rely on the work of this sector along the value chain such as innovation, industrial engineering, and fabrication work.</p>
<p>TechSci Research has issued a report stating that during 2013-2015, the automotive industry in Sri Lanka had a new vehicle registration growth rate of 350%. This highlights the economic growth spur of the country and this to create a further multiplier effect which leads to automotive repairs, services, as well as maintenance services for manufacturing and service establishments. </p>
<p>Light engineering is further expected to expand in parallel with construction, transport, agricultural and the household goods sector.</p>
<p>The main employment opportunities in the automotive and light engineering sectors are mechanics, machinists, welders and sheet workers. However so, the industry is slowly migrating from a labor intensive regime towards capital intensive and equipment based technologies. </p>
<p>Vocational training in Automotive and Light Engineering is a great way to start a career in this ever-growing industry. You will be trained by professionals who will make sure you receive the right guidance.
